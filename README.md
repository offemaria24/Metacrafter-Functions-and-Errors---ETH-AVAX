# Functions and Errors -- ETH-AVAX

**Overview**

This project provides a simple smart contract in Solidity that demonstrates the use of functions and error handling. The contract is designed for both the Ethereum (ETH) and Avalanche (AVAX) blockchains.

## Description

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract that showcases the use of functions and error handling for the ETH and AVAX blockchains. The contract includes functions to set and retrieve a balance, along with a modifier to restrict access to the contract owner. This project serves as an educational resource for individuals interested in learning about smart contract development within the Ethereum and Avalanche ecosystems.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To utilize this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/eth-avax-functions-errors.git
Ensure you have a development environment configured for Ethereum and Avalanche smart contract development, which includes the Solidity compiler and any required dependencies.
Executing Program
To deploy and interact with the smart contract, follow these instructions:

Navigate to the project directory:
cd eth-avax-functions-errors

Compile the smart contract using your preferred Solidity compiler.

Deploy the contract to your chosen Ethereum or Avalanche blockchain using your preferred development environment or tools.

Interact with the deployed contract by calling its functions, such as setUniqueBalance, checkUniqueInput, and getUnique, using a blockchain wallet or development environment.
