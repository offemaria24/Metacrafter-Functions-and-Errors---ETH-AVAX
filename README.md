# Functions and Errors -- ETH-AVAX

**Overview**

This project provides a simple smart contract in Solidity that demonstrates the use of functions and error handling. The contract is designed for both the Ethereum (ETH) and Avalanche (AVAX) blockchains.

## Description

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract that showcases the use of functions and error handling for the ETH and AVAX blockchains. The contract includes functions to set and retrieve a balance, along with a modifier to restrict access to the contract owner. This project serves as an educational resource for individuals interested in learning about smart contract development within the Ethereum and Avalanche ecosystems.

## Getting Started

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., HelloWorld.sol). 

Then apply the code provided

To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile MetaCrafterTokenProject.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MetaCrafterTokenProject" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.
